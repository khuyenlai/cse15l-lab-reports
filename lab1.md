Using cat with no argument allows users to print any input coming from the keyboard. As such, I used control c to end the command and return to my directory (which is the home directory). This would not result in an error.
When using cat with a directory as an argument, it would print that the directory in the argument "is a directory" which wouldn't result in an error. The reason being is that the directory exists and is being printed in the terminal.
